# Release Notes - QA Issue Fixes

## Version: Form Validation Improvements

### 🐛 Fixed Issues

#### Issue 1: Order Date Validation Timing ✅
**Problem**: Order date validation happened too late, allowing navigation to next step even when booking date > delivery date.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added real-time validation in `OrderGeneralInfoStep` using `useEffect` to watch both `bookingDate` and `deliveryDate`
- Implemented immediate cross-field validation that displays error as soon as invalid date combination is detected
- Added `onBlur` validation triggers on both date fields to validate immediately when user leaves field
- Enhanced step validation logic in `OrderMultiStepForm` to check for cross-field validation errors before allowing navigation
- Now blocks navigation to next step if booking date > delivery date

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `src/components/forms/order-steps/general-info-step.tsx`
- Updated `src/components/forms/order-multistep-form.tsx`
- Added real-time validation using `useEffect` and form watch functionality
- Enhanced step validation to include cross-field validation checks

#### Issue 2: Advance Payment Input Error ✅  
**Problem**: Leaving advance payment field blank caused undefined errors during form processing.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated input handling logic to properly handle empty values by defaulting to 0
- Added `onBlur` validation to ensure field always has a valid numeric value
- Improved onChange logic to handle empty strings, null, and undefined values gracefully
- Added helpful text: "Leave blank if no advance payment (defaults to 0)"
- Applied consistent handling to both `totalAmount` and `advancePaid` fields
- Updated default form values to initialize payment fields with 0 instead of undefined

**Technical Changes**:
- Modified `src/components/forms/order-steps/payment-step.tsx`
- Updated `src/components/forms/order-multistep-form.tsx`
- Improved input value handling with proper null/undefined checks
- Added user-friendly helper text for advance payment field

### ✅ Quality Assurance

- **Linting**: Passed with only pre-existing warnings (no new issues introduced)
- **Build**: Successfully compiles with no TypeScript errors
- **Type Safety**: Maintained strong typing throughout the codebase
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing functionality preserved

### 📋 Testing Notes

Both fixes should now provide:
1. **Real-time feedback**: Users see validation errors immediately when they occur
2. **Navigation blocking**: Cannot proceed to next step with invalid data
3. **Graceful error handling**: No more undefined errors in payment fields
4. **Better UX**: Clear error messages and helpful guidance text

### 🔧 Technical Details

The fixes maintain the existing React Hook Form architecture and follow the DRY principle. All validation logic integrates seamlessly with the existing form validation patterns using Zod schemas and proper form state management.
