## âœ… Fixed Issues

### 1. **Removed Unused Header Icons**
**Changes Made:**
- **Removed notification icon** (Bell) from dashboard header
- **Removed user profile icon** (User) from dashboard header
- **Cleaned up imports** to remove unused icon components
- **Maintained theme toggle** as the only remaining header utility

**Files Modified:**

**Result:**
- Cleaner, more minimal header design

- Better use of screen space

### 2. **Enhanced Order Measurements Step with Inline Form**
**Major Enhancement:**
- **Replaced redirect behavior** with comprehensive inline measurement form
- **Added tabbed interface** with "Saved Measurements" and "Create New" tabs
- **Complete measurement form** with all body measurement fields
- **Customer info automatically populated** from Step 1 (no redundant customer selection)
- **Seamless workflow** that keeps users within the order creation process

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/forms/order-steps/measurements-step.tsx` - Complete rewrite with tabbed interface
- `src/components/ui/tabs.tsx` - Created new tabs component for better UI

**Technical Implementation:**
