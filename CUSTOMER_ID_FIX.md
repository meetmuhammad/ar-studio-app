# Fix: Customer ID Validation Error

## 🐛 Issue
When clicking the "Create New Order" button, users encountered an "Invalid customer ID" error immediately upon opening the order creation dialog, before even having a chance to select a customer.

## 🔍 Root Cause
The issue was caused by the form validation mode being set to `"onTouched"`, which triggered validation as soon as the form was initialized. Since the `customerId` field starts with an empty string `""` but the validator expects a valid UUID, the validation failed immediately.

## ✅ Solution
Changed the form validation mode from `"onTouched"` to `"onSubmit"` in the order multistep form component.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/forms/order-multistep-form.tsx` - Line 38
- `src/lib/validators.ts` - Updated error message for better UX

**Changes Made:**
```typescript
// Before
mode: "onTouched", // Only validate after field is touched

// After  
mode: "onSubmit", // Only validate on submit or manual trigger
```

Also updated the validator error message:
```typescript
// Before
customerId: z.string().uuid("Invalid customer ID"),

// After
customerId: z.string().uuid("Please select a customer"),
```

## 🎯 Impact
- ✅ **Fixed**: No more immediate "Invalid customer ID" error when opening order dialog
- ✅ **Improved**: Better error message that guides user action ("Please select a customer")
- ✅ **Maintained**: All existing validation still works properly during step navigation and form submission
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Form only validates when user actually tries to proceed or submit

## 🔧 How It Works Now
1. User clicks "Create New Order" → Dialog opens without validation errors
2. User interacts with form fields → No premature validation
3. User clicks "Next" or "Submit" → Validation triggers only then
4. If customer not selected → Shows "Please select a customer" error
5. User selects customer → Validation passes, can proceed

## ✅ Testing
- **Build**: ✅ Compiles successfully without errors
- **Validation**: ✅ Still properly validates customer selection when needed  
- **User Experience**: ✅ Smooth form initialization without premature errors
- **Backward Compatibility**: ✅ All existing functionality preserved

The order creation dialog now opens cleanly without validation errors, allowing users to naturally fill in the form step by step! 🎉
